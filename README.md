portqgis
========

a port of qgis0.01 using wxwidget GUI library.

qgis is a opensource GIS program now evolving to 2.0, detailed information can get from here: 
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/.

for learning , I using the qgis 0.01 version, just about several hundreds lines of codes. you can get it here:http://ie.archive.ubuntu.com/disk1/disk1/sourceforge/q/project/qg/qgis/OldFiles/


using the libqpxx(the c++ client API of PostgreSQL) to read GIS data from postgresql. you can get it here: https://pqxx.org/development/libpqxx/


and using the wxWdiget GUI library to show the GUI and the drawing things. you can get the wxwidget here:
https://www.wxwidgets.org/


the code is not properly organized, just a test and practice program, but its function can work properly, 
can add postgres database connecton and show the data graphically properly.
