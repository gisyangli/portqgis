portqgis
========

a port of qgis0.01 using wxwidget GUI library


using the libqpxx(the c++ client API of PostgreSQL) to read GIS data from postgresql. 

and using the wxWdiget GUI library to show the GUI and the drawing things. 

the code is not properly organized, just a test and practice program, but its function can work properly.
